# tower-cipher
Mechanical 3D printable cipher device.

[STL](STL/README.md) contains printable files and assembly instructions.
In the [Model](Model/README.md) folder there is a Blender source file for the whole device.
[Tools/Pathways generator](Tools/PathwaysGenerator/README.md) is the tool I've created for generating internal pathways.
